#OO Programming Challenge 02c 

This challenge is designed to demonstrate your PHP OO design and implementation skills in a real world (time constrained) environment.
 
Time allowed: 1.5 hours
 
#Scenario

We need to build an order dispatch system, for sending out customer orders with one of a number of different couriers.
 
At the start of a normal working day, a new batch will be started, and it will be closed at the end of the day, when no more parcels are going to be shipped. This is called the dispatch period.
 
Each parcel sent out with a courier is called a consignment. Each consignment will be given a unique number - each courier will supply an algorithm for generating their own format of consignment numbers.
 
At the end of each dispatch period, a list of all the consignment numbers needs to be sent to each individual courier. The method of data transport varies from courier to courier (e.g. Royal Mail use email, ANC use anonymous FTP). 
#What you should produce
 
Build a class structure to facilitate the implementation of the scenario set out above. Assume that your class library will be given to another developer at a later date to build the interface for the client.
 
The client interface will have three primary functions; 
1. Start new batch 
2. Add consignment 
3. End current batch 
#What we are evaluating 
We’ll be reviewing your OO analysis and design skills based on the object structure you choose and to some extent your understanding and ability with PHP based on the code you produce.
 
Use class/method commenting (ideally phpDoc format) to explain your design decisions. Code re-use, extensibility and maintenance are all important.
 
#Notes 
Make as much progress as you feel you can within the time allowed; you are not required to produce a final product.
 
Do not worry about persistent storage/database abstraction layers/html/visuals – focus on the business logic and class structures.
 
#My own notes based on the brief

Started at 10:25, read the brief some time before to get familiar with the concept.

Create a system to hold a day worth of data for an order issue system.

Starting a day opens up a new batch, so give a sign somewhere that we can take new orders, like set a bool to true and maybe current date?
 
Each order gets a number basing on the assigned courier's algorithm. In here I assume that the courier is being chosen and passed as a parameter.

At the end of the day, send all the consignment IDs to the appropriate couriers (many ways, e.g. FTP, mailer, maybe even pinging or Morse code, who knows?) and set the available bool to false.

pause at 10:55

resume at 11:13

should finish at 11:55+18mins = 12:13

I got stuck on having multiple couriers, as I dont want to hardcode the names in, but i have to.
another pause, 11:42

back - 12:13
got extra 31 minutes
12:44 should finish

finished 12:46 after testing. It was more of extreme programming as I have no tests written and checked only perfect case.

I really hope you like it.

And again, sorry for using a string class name, it hurts my heart too.
